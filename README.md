### Change Log

- **08/2022** - Added CP4I version, fixed broken links
-  **07/2022** - Initial Release

  
> This collection of Cloud Pak for Integration terraform automation layers has been crafted from a set of [Terraform modules](https://modules.cloudnativetoolkit.dev/) created by the IBM GSI Ecosystem Lab team part of the [IBM Partner Ecosystem organization](https://www.ibm.com/partnerworld/public?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=partnerworld). Please contact **Matthew Perrins**  _mjperrin@us.ibm.com_, **Sean Sundberg**  _seansund@us.ibm.com_, **Andrew Trice**  _amtrice@us.ibm.com_, **Gowdhaman Jayaseelan**  _gjayasee@in.ibm.com_, **Keshav Anand**  _keshav.anand@in.ibm.com_, **Vijay K Sukthankar**  _vksuktha@in.ibm.com_ or **Jyoti Rani**  _jyotirani10@in.ibm.com_ for more details or raise an issue on the repository.

  
The automation will support the installation of Cloud Pak for Integration on three cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, and IBM Cloud). As an initial effort it was decided to choose the key & essential capabilities such as Integration PlatformNavigator, API connect, App Connect Enterprise, Mq, EventStreams of Cloud Pak for Integration.

⚠️`IMPORTANT: Please be noted. In this release, the focus is only on key/essential cabilities like PlatformNavigator, IBM APIConnect, IBM APPConnect, IBM Event Streams & IBM MQ. In future release, other capabilities like IBM Aspera, IBM DataPower, AssetRepo & OperationDashboard will be considered based on the customer or partner needs.` ⚠️
  
### Releases

## Target Infrastructure

The Cloud Pak for Integration - automation assumes you have an OpenShift cluster already configured on your cloud of choice. The supported OpenShift options are [ROSA for AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/rosa/), [ROKS for IBM Cloud ](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift) or OpenShift IPI instances.

Before you start to install and configure Cloud Pak for Integration, you will need to identify what your target infrastructure is going to be. You can start from scratch and use one of the pre-defined reference architectures from IBM or bring your own.

### Reference Architectures

The reference architectures are provided in three different forms, with increasing security and associated sophistication to support production configuration. These three forms are as follows:

- **Quick Start** - a simple architecture to quickly get an OpenShift cluster provisioned
- **Standard** - a standard production deployment environment with typical security protections such as private endpoints, VPN server, key management encryption, etc
- **Advanced** - a more advanced deployment that employs multiple virtual networks to isolate and securely route traffic between the different layers

  
For each of these reference architecture, we have provided a detailed set of automation to create the environment for the software. If you do not have an OpenShift environment provisioned, please use one of these. They are optimized for the installation of this solution.


Note: [Cloud Pak for Integration system requirements](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-integration/2021.4?topic=planning-system-requirements) recommend at least 3 worker nodes, with minimum 16vCPU per node and minimum 64 GB RAM per done (128 GB RAM is recommended).

| Bring Your Own Infrastructure           | You will need a cluster with at least 16 CPUs and 64 GB of memory per node and at least 3 nodes to support storage and IBM Cloud Paks.                                                          

## Getting Started

Within this repository you will find a set of Terraform template bundles that embody best practices for provisioning the Cloud Pak for Integration in multiple cloud environments. This `README.md` describes the SRE steps required to provision the CP4I software.

This suite of automation can be used for a Proof of Technology environment, or used as a foundation for production workloads with a fully working end-to-end cloud-native environment. The software installs using **GitOps** best practices with [**Red Hat Open Shift GitOps**](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/cicd/gitops/understanding-openshift-gitops.html)

### Integration Architecture

The following reference architecture represents the logical view of how CP4I works after it is installed. CP4i is deployed with either Portworx or OpenShift Data Foundation storage, within an OpenShift Cluster, on the Cloud provider of your choice.

## Deploying Cloud Pak for Integration

The following instructions will help you install Cloud Pak for Integration into AWS, Azure, and IBM Cloud OpenShift Kubernetes environment.

### Licenses and Entitlements

Details on Cloud Pak for Integration licensing available at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-integration/2021.4?topic=planning-licensing

### Obtaining your IBM entitlement API key
To install Cloud Pak for Integration you are required to have an entitlement key that provides access to the software components. After the necessary entitlements have been granted, use the following steps to download the entitlement key and apply it to the automation:

1. Visit the Container Software Library site - https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary
2. Log in with your IBMId credentials
3. Assuming the entitlements are in place, you will be presented with an entitlement key. Click "Copy key".
4. Open your "credentials.template" file and paste the entitlement key in for the value of `TF_VAR_entitlement_key`


###  Cloud Pak for Integration for Multi Cloud
The Integration capabilities automation is broken into what we call layers of automation or bundles. The bundles enable SRE activities to be optimized. The automation is generic between clouds other than configuration storage options, which are platform specific.

## Installation Steps

> At this time the most reliable way of running this automation is with Terraform in your local machine either through a bootstrapped container image or with native tools installed. We provide a Container image that has all the common SRE tools installed. [CLI Tools Image,](https://quay.io/repository/ibmgaragecloud/cli-tools?tab=tags) [Source Code for CLI Tools](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/image-cli-tools)
Before you start the installation please install the pre-req tools on your machine.

Before you start the installation please install the pre-req tools on your machine.


### Pre-Req Setup
Please install the following Pre-Req tools to help you get started with the SRE tasks for installing Cloud Pak for Integration into an existing OpenShift Cluster on AWS, Azure, or IBM Cloud.

#### MacOS environment

Pre-requisites:
- Check you have a valid GitHub ID that can be used to create a repository in your own organization [GitHub]( https://github.com/) or GitHub Enterprise account.
- Install a code editor. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install [Brew](https://brew.sh/)

Ensure the following before continuing
- Github account exists
- A Github [token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.3/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) is available with permissions set to create and remove repositories
- You are able to login to the OpenShift cluster and obtain an OpenShift login token
- Cloud Pak entitlement key, this can be obtained from visiting the [IBM Container Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary)

### Installing Integration Platform

The installation process will use a standard GitOps repository that has been built using the Modules to support CP4I platform installation. The automation is consistent across three cloud environments AWS, Azure, and IBM Cloud.


#### Set up the runtime environment

At this time the most reliable way of running this automation is with Terraform in your local machine either through a bootstrapped docker image or Virtual Machine. We provide both a [container image](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/image-cli-tools) and a virtual machine [cloud-init](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/sre-utilities/blob/main/cloud-init/cli-tools.yaml) script that have all the common SRE tools installed.

We recommend using Docker Desktop if choosing the container image method, and Multipass if choosing the virtual machine method.   Detailed instructions for downloading and configuring both Docker Desktop and Multipass can be found in [RUNTIMES.md](./RUNTIMES.md)


#### Set up environment credentials

1. First step is to clone the automation code to your local machine. Run this git command in your favorite command line shell.

	```
	git clone git@github.com:IBM/automation-integration-platform.git
	```
2. From the command line, navigate into the `automation-integration-platform` folder from the command line

    a. The README.md has the comprehensive instructions on how to install this into other cloud environments than TechZone. This document focuses on getting it running in a TechZone requested environment.

	```
	cd automation-integration-platform
	```

3. Next you will need to set-up your credentials.properties file. This will enable secure access to your cluster.

    ```shell
    cp credentials.template credentials.properties
    code credential.properties
    ```

    ```text
    # Add the values for the Credentials to access the IBM Cloud
    # Instructions to access this information can be found in the README.MD
    # This is a template file and the ./launch.sh script looks for a file based on this template named credentials.properties
    
    ## gitops_repo_username: The username of the user with access to the repository
    export TF_VAR_gitops_repo_username=
    
    ## gitops_repo_token: The personal access token used to access the repository
    export TF_VAR_gitops_repo_token=
    
    ## TF_VAR_cluster_login_token: Token used for authentication to the api server
    export TF_VAR_cluster_login_token=
    
    ## TF_VAR_server_url: The url for the OpenShift api server
    export TF_VAR_server_url=
    
    ## TF_VAR_entitlement_key: The entitlement key used to access the IBM software images in the container registry. Visit https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary to get the key
    export TF_VAR_entitlement_key=
    
    
    ## TF_VAR_ibmcloud_api_key: IBM Cloud API Key required to provision storage on IBM Cloud
    export TF_VAR_ibmcloud_api_key=
    
    # Only needed if targeting AWS Deployment
    export TF_VAR_access_key=
    export TF_VAR_secret_key=
    
    ##
    ## Azure credentials
    ## Credentials are required to install Portworx on an Azure account. These credentials must have
    ## particular permissions in order to interact with the account and the OpenShift cluster. Use the
    ## provided `azure-portworx-credentials.sh` script to retrieve/generate these credentials.
    ##
    # Only needed if targeting Azure Deployment
    
    ## TF_VAR_azure_subscription_id: The subscription id for the Azure account. This is required if Azure portworx is used
    export TF_VAR_azure_subscription_id=
    ## TF_VAR_azure_tenant_id: The tenant id for the Azure account. This is required if Azure portworx is used
    export TF_VAR_azure_tenant_id=
    ## TF_VAR_azure_client_id: The client id of the user for the Azure account. This is required if Azure portworx is used
    export TF_VAR_azure_client_id=
    ## TF_VAR_azure_client_secret: The client id of the user for the Azure account. This is required if Azure portworx is used
    export TF_VAR_azure_client_secret=
   ```

 4. You will need to populate these values. Add your Git Hub username and your Personal Access Token to `TF_VAR_gitops_repo_username` and `TF_VAR_gitops_repo_token`.

 5. From you OpenShift console click on top right menu and select Copy login command and click on Display Token

    ![Copy Login Command](images/ocp_login_command.png)
      
  
 6. Copy the API Token value into the `cluster_login_token` value and Server URL into the `server_url` value, only the part starting with https

    ![Copy Server URL and LoginToken](images/server_url_and_token.png)

 7. Copy the entitlement key, this can be obtained from visiting the [IBM Container Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) and place it in the `entitlement_key` variable.



##### Configure Storage
###### Deploying on IBM Cloud (Portworx or ODF)

1. Provide the IBM Cloud API Key for the target IBM Cloud account as the value for `TF_VAR_ibmcloud_api_key`

###### Deploying on Azure (Portworx)

If Cloud Pak for Integration will be deployed on OpenShift deployed on Azure, the credentials for the Azure account need to be
provided. Several clis are required for these steps:

- `az` cli - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
- `jq` cli - https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/

You can install these clis on your local machine **OR** run the following commands within the provided container image by running `launch.sh` 

1. Log into your Azure account

    ```shell
    az login
    ```

2. Run the `azure-portworx-credentials.sh` script to gather/create the credentials:

    ```shell
    ./azure-portworx-credentials.sh -t {cluster type} -g {resource group name} -n {cluster name} [-s {subscription id}]
    ```

    where:
    - **cluster type** is the type of OpenShift cluster (`aro` or `ipi`).
    - **resource group name** is the name of the Azure resource group where the cluster has been provisioned.
    - **cluster name** is the name of the OpenShift cluster.
    - **subscription id** is the subscription id of the Azure account. If a value is not provided it will be looked up.

3. Update `credentials.properties` with the values output from the script.

    ```json
    {
      "azure_client_id": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
      "azure_client_secret": "XXXXXXX",
      "azure_tenant_id": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
      "azure_subscription_id": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
    ```

4. If you used the container image to run the script, type `exit` to close the container shell then re-rung `launch.sh` to pick up the changes to the environment variables.

##### Configure the automation

###### Get the Portworx configuration spec (for AWS or Azure deployments)

5. Follow the steps to download the [portworx confituration spec](./PORTWORX_CONFIG.md)
6. Copy the downloaded file into the root directory of the cloned automation-maximo-app-suite repository


###### Set up the runtime environment

At this time the most reliable way of running this automation is with Terraform in your local machine either through a bootstrapped docker image or Virtual Machine. We provide both a [container image](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/image-cli-tools) and a virtual machine [cloud-init](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/sre-utilities/blob/main/cloud-init/cli-tools.yaml) script that have all the common SRE tools installed.

We recommend using Docker Desktop if choosing the container image method, and Multipass if choosing the virtual machine method.   Detailed instructions for downloading and configuring both Docker Desktop and Multipass can be found in [RUNTIMES.md](./RUNTIMES.md)

⚠️IMPORTANT NOTE: ⚠️ DO-NOT SKIP [RUNTIMES.md](./RUNTIMES.md). In this step you need to setup either Docker Desktop or Multipass runtime. Without setting this up the further steps can not be executed.


> We expect partners and clients will use their own specific **Continuous Integration** tools to support this the IBM team has focused on getting it installed in the least complicated way possible


##### Set up the automation workspace

1. Launch the automation runtime. Ensure the current working directory is 'automation-integration-platform'
    - If using *Docker Desktop*, run `./launch.sh`. This will start a container image with the prompt opened in the `/terraform` directory.
    - If using *Multipass*, run `mutlipass shell cli-tools` to start the interactive shell, and cd into the `/automation/{template}` directory, where  `{template}` is the folder you've cloned this repo. Be sure to run `source credentials.properties` once in the shell.

2. Next we need to set up the working directory for the automation:
   ⚠️`IMPORTANT NOTE:` ⚠️  setup-workspace.sh script is responsible for choosing the required module to be deployed on Openshift Cluster. The module we refer here is cater to "GitOps,Storage & Cloud Pak capabilities(PlatformNavigator,APIC,MQ,ACE & EventStreams)". 
    
   ```shell
        ./setup-workspace.sh [-p {cloud provider}] [-s {storage}] [-n {prefix name}] [-x {portworx spec file}]
   ```
    
   where:
   - **cloud provider**  - the target cloud provider for the deployment (`aws`, `azure`, or `ibm`)
   - **storage**  - the intended storage provider (`portworx` or `odf`)
   - **prefix name** (optional) - the name prefix that will be used for the gitops repo
   - **portworx spec file** (optional) - the name of the file containing the Portworx configuration spec yaml
   
    At this stage, We assume you have Openshift Cluster is up & running. Following info will help the user in setting up the right workspace.
    ```
    if [OpenShift Cluster is already provioned with 'Storage']         
        There is No necessacity to execute any module cater to provision Storage in cluster. Hence
         ./setup-workspace.sh -p ibm 
    else
        if [OpenShift Cluster is Provisoned on IBM Cloud && No Storage Provisioned]
            In IBM Cloud you have a choice to provision 'Open Data Foundation' or 'Portworx'
            In case 
                'OpenData Foundation' :
                    ./setup-workspace.sh -p ibm -s odf 
                'portworx' :
                    ./setup-workspace.sh -p ibm -s portworx  [-x {portworx spec file}]
                    
        if [OpenShift Cluster is Provisoned on Azure && No Storage Provisioned]
            In Azure, at this point of time you can only go with 'portworx'
                    ./setup-workspace.sh -p azure -s portworx  [-x {portworx spec file}]

        if [OpenShift Cluster is Provisoned on aws && No Storage Provisioned]
            In aws, at this point of time you can only go with 'portworx'
                    ./setup-workspace.sh -p aws -s portworx  [-x {portworx spec file}]

    fi        
    ```

3. The `setup-workspace.sh` script configures the `terraform.tfvars` file with reasonable defaults. There are no other changes required in order to run the automation.

     **Note:** 
     The default `terraform.tfvars` file is symbolically linked to the new `workspaces/current` folder so this enables you to edit the file in your native operating system using your editor of choice.

The following are variables that you will be updating. Here are some suggested values.

1. Update the desired values in `terraform.tfvars`
2. Save the `terraform.tfvars` file

#### Apply the automation
1. We are now ready to start installing Cloud Pak for Integration. Ensure you are inside the running container or Multipass VM.
2. Within the container terminal, change directory to the `/workspaces/current` folder. This folder was populated by the `setup-workspaces.sh` script in the previous step. (The `launch.sh` command configures a named volume to preserve the contents of the `/workspaces` directory between container images so you don't need to re-run `setup-workspaces.sh` again unless you want to configure a different environment.)

3. Run `./apply-all.sh` to kick off the automation. The script will apply each layer in order.
Cloud Pak fo Integration deployment will run asynchronously in the background, and may require up to 90 to 100 minutes to complete.

4. You can check the progress by looking at two places, first look in your github repository. You will see the git repository has been created based on the name you have provided. The Cloud Pak for Integration install will populate this with information to let OpenShift GitOps install the software. The second place is to look at the OpenShift console, Click Workloads->Pods and you will see the GitOps operator being installed. 
    You can also check the progress of the deployment by opening up Argo CD (OpenShift GitOps). From the OpenShift user interface, click on the Application menu 3x3 Icon on the header and select **Cluster Argo CD** menu item.)

5. Once deployment is complete, go back into the OpenShift cluster user interface and navigate to view `Routes` for the `cp4i-pn` namespace. Here you can see the URL to the deployed Platform Navigator instance. Open this url in a new browser window.

6.  Navigate to `Secrets` in the `ibm-common-services` namespace, and find the `platform-auth-idp-credentials` secret. Copy the value of `password` key inside of that secret.

7. Go back to the PlatformNavigator instance that you opened in a separate window. Log in using the username `admin` with the password copied in the previous step.

## How to Generate this repository from the source Bill of Materials.

This set of automation packages was generated using the open-source [`isacable`](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/iascable) tool. This tool enables a [Bill of Material yaml](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/automation-solutions/tree/main/boms/software/maximo) file to describe your software requirements. If you want up stream releases or versions you can use `iascable` to generate a new terraform module.

> The `iascable` tool is targeted for use by advanced SRE developers. It requires deep knowledge of how the modules plug together into a customized architecture. This repository is a fully tested output from that tool. This makes it ready to consume for projects.
